If you know me, you already know that I like natural language processing, nature, photography, and a number of other things[^1].

If you don't know me and want to know more about what I do for living, check out [my GitHub](https://github.com/samsucik).

If you don't know me and want to know more about what I live for, skip ahead to some of my [pictures](/birds) to get a taste.
